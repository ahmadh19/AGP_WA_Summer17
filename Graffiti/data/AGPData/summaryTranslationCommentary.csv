EDR151816,10500,,,3,Lagoena,Mention of a flask (?),Flasks," Written in charcol (carbone), the Text of CIL IV. 10500 reads lagunas, which Della Corte corrects to ‚Äúlagoenas‚Äù. Lagoenae, or lagunae, were narrow-necked bottles, typically used to serve wine (s.v. Oxford Latin Dictionary, 1982). Alternate spellings include lagona, lagena, and lagoena. The word is adapted from the Greek ŒªŒ±Œ≥œÖŒΩŒøœÇ, o. Cf. CIL VI. 1884 and CIL VI. 8866.



Linguistics:
        Lagoena was originally spelled and pronounced with an ≈´, equivalent to the Greek œÖ, given evidence from Plautus, who assonates the y (upsilon) in Greek names with the ≈´ in Latin (see Plautus, Mil. 324; Bacch. 129; Anderson, Andrew R. ""The Use of the Oe-Diphthong in Plautus."" Classical Philology 4, no. 3 (1909): 291-300. http://www.jstor.org/stable/262394). Laguna, then, is an almost direct adaption from the Greek ŒªŒ±Œ≥œÖŒΩŒøœÇ. Merely the gender and the stress, which in the Greek receeds to the Œ±, have been corrupted-though ŒªŒ±Œ≥œÖŒΩŒøœÇ was considered feminine by Greek speakers in Thessaly (s.v. Greek-English Lexicon, Liddell and Scott, 1968). Despite the general rule that the ≈ì reduces to the long ≈´ in Latin (Bennett, Charles. The Latin Language. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1907. 9-10), the spelling variant lagoena did not arise until the imperial period (ibid.). 

Appearance and function:
        While not restricted solely to this use, lagunae were most commonly used to carry wine (see CIL VI. 1884 and CIL VI. 8866). They usually had long, narrow necks and big bodies. As Columella states in 10.383-7 ‚ÄúBut if you are looking for a gourd of globelike shape which swells out vastly with ample paunch, then choose a seed from the middle of the belly; this will produce capacious fruit fit to make a vessel for Narycian pitch or Attic honey from Hymettus, or a pail handy for water, or a flagon (laguna) of wine.‚Äù Furthermore, Columella describes a laguna as having a ‚Äúwide mouth‚Äù. It is unclear whether this applies to all lagunae or a select few (White, K. D. Farm Equipment of the Ancient World. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 161-164).

It also appears twice in the catalogue of names at Herculaneum CIL X.01403. There is appears as the nomen gentilicium of two freedmen, who would have taken that name from their master. Both of the Vibidius' mentioned are freedmen of Aulus Vibidius which we can tell becasue both names say freedmen of Aulus, and becuase it is customary for a freedmen to take the praenomen of his master.

In Pompeii we see large painted announcements of games, but this is very different because it is on a much smaller and less public scale. It states there will be a match that will have ten pairs of gladiators figthing. It is also important to note that the benefactor of these games appears to be a single person: Numisius Genialis. Advertisements in Pompeii usually announce twenty pairs of gladiators, so by comparison this a much smaller fight but still impressive since it seems that there is only a single benefactor. This graffito shows that there was a gladiatorial presence in the city of Herculaneum. There are also drawings of gladiator helmets which show that there was interest in gladiators in the city. Gladiatorial games were often used to improve public morale and were put on by the political elite to gain more popularity in the city. Evidence of gladiatorial games come from all over the Roman world, so is a common event. 
This graffito also provides an example of the dating system the Romans used. Instead of numbering the days of the month from one to thirty, the Romans named only three days in the month: the kalends, the nonnes, and the ides. The rest of the days were counted backwards from the closest named date. In this case the date that the games will be held is eight days before the kalends of March, meaning eight days before the first of March, which is February 24th.","Dates, Names, male, gladiators, kalends, Roman Numerals, Number, gladiator contest ",,Y,"This graffito is an informal message giving details about a gladiatorial spectacle. In Pompeii, large painted notices served as advertisements for gladiatorial games. This graffito provides some of the same details (date of the match, number of gladiators to fight, location of games), but this message was scratched into wall plaster as a personal reminder or note, and is much smaller than the large, public notices at Pompeii. The graffito details a match featuring ten pairs of gladiators. Advertisements in Pompeii usually announce twenty pairs of gladiators, so this event at Herculaneum was smaller but still impressive. The gladiators all appear to belong to the same troupe, owned by Numisius Genialis. This message is a rare piece of evidence that points to a gladiatorial presence in the city of Herculaneum. A house in Insula V also features drawings of gladiator helmets, likewise incised (i.e. figural graffiti), which further show interest in gladiators in this city. Gladiatorial games were often used to improve public morale and were put on by the political elite to gain popularity. Evidence of gladiatorial games comes from all over the Roman world, and the spectacles inspired much enthusiasm.This graffito provides an example of the calendar system the Romans used. Instead of numbering the days of the month from one to thirty, the Romans named only three days in the month: the Kalends, the Nones, and the Ides. All other days counted backwards to the next named date. In this case, games will be (or were) held eight days before the Kalends of March, i.e., eight days before the first of March, or February 24th (counting inclusively).",,,- - - ,no access (2016),None Available,,,,,,,,

He is directly addressing  a woman, Primigenia, whom he calls his mistress or lover, who he thought would read his message.

She has all the information needed to locate him, if she so desires. Pompeii attests to at least two other addresses scratched into the wall plaster with similar instructions. 
Some little controversy has been sparked over the identity of the woman mentioned in this graffito, Primigenia. While Primigenia is a common name represented in this region, especially in Pompeii (see CIL IV 3976, 5358, 8175, 8260, 8274, 830?1, 8356, 10241), certain scholars have suggested that they all belong to a single individual. Della Corte argues that she was a traveling actress or a vivacious female intellectual, something of a first century pop-icon from Nuceria (one of the inscriptions mentioning her name leaves an address). However, Verone differs, saying that the sheer number of hands these inscriptions are written in, their locations (the baths, the lupinare), and even the name of the street Primigenia lived on (the Venarian road) suggest that she may have been a high class prostitute. See: erotica Pompeiana by Verone and Loves and Lovers in Ancient Pompeii by Della Corte.","People, Names, Male, Geography, Puteoli",Verbs,Y,"This three line graffito is written by the slave, Hermeros, in the suburban baths.
